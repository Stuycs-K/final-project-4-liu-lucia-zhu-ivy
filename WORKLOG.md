# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1 (LUCIA LIU)

### date 5/22/24

Created the Tetris, Blocks, and Grid classes; pushed it to Git. Figuring out merging and branch mechanics. Created two new branches, one for each person.

### date 5/23/24

Created Tetris playing grid (20 x 10 blocks), where is where blocks will appear and drop. 

### date 5/24/24

Created 6 signs, which will be used to indicate score, top score, time, next block that will drop, number of lines cleared,
and the current falling speed of the blocks. 

### date 5/25/24

Added 2 more signs (one showing block statistics and the other displaying the current mode: sand or normal)

### date 5/28/24

Worked on Grid class; Coded spawnBlocks, which takes a random tetromino from a "bag" 
(represented by the ArrayList toSpawn) and sets the instance variable curr to said tetromino.

### date 6/2/24

Worked on Grid class; ran into a couple of problems, such as slow speed when the fall() mechanics
is implemented, plus the trail that the tetromino leaves behind as it falls. Currently 
trying to incorporate tetrominos into the grid once they reach the bottom. Also trying to change
the 2D array to an ArrayList of arrays.
