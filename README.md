## Overview
We are recreating Tetris, including necessary features such as 7 tetrominos, 
point systems, and arrow keys: left, right, down, up, and space.
The up arrow is used for rotations, which allows our pieces to rotate clockwise.
Pressing the down arrow adds one point each press and space bar brings the block down immediately.
Our tetris board is 10x17 and we have multipliers for when you clear multiple rows at once. 
We display your points, lines cleared, high score, the next tetromino, and the tetrominos that 
have came out so far. 
## Instructions
We imported ArrayList.

up: rotate
down: move down
left: move left
right: move right
space: down to the lowest possible place the block can land
p: play/pause
q: restart
